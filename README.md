# GrillNation

While taking the course "Web Technology" during my bachelor everyone in my class assigned a different task, mine was to design a responsive website within a week.

So I created a fictional restaurant called "**Grill Nation**", inspired by two local restaurant _BBQ Nation_ and _The Mad Grill_.
